# CHAT_APP

This is just a standard Chat App I created so that i could learn how socket.io and WebRTC work.
It allows you to search for any user who is using the app and then you can choose to communicate with them.
There are still a few errors currently with the WebRTC part, mainly when the video call ends but i will fix it soon.
The app also verifies your email using NodeMailer.

Apart from this i have also hosted the app using DOCKER and have also written tests for my API calls in my server.
