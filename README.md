# CHAT_APP

This is just a standard Chat App I created so that i could learn how socket.io and WebRTC work.
It allows you to search for any user who is using the app and then you can choose to communicate with them.
The app also verifies your email using NodeMailer.

Apart from this i have also hosted the app using DOCKER and have also used Redis for caching Sockets which helps in improving the latency of the application.
